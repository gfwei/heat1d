# heat1d
Thermal model for planetary science applications

Author: Paul O. Hayne

Date: September 8, 2017

This repository contains source code and examples for the `heat1d` planetary thermal model. In its present form, `heat1d` uses a finite difference approach to solve the one-dimensional heat equation. Key features include depth- and temperature-dependent thermophysical properties, and boundary conditions appropriate to different planetary bodies.

Implementations in three different languages are in development: `C`, `MATLAB`, and `Python`. Each implementation is contained in its own subdirectory, with instructions for installing, running, and customizing the code.
